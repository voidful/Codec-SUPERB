## Batch Processing

**ðŸš€ NEW: Efficient Batch Processing Support**

Codec-SUPERB now supports efficient batch processing for encoding and decoding multiple audio samples simultaneously, eliminating the need for for loops and providing significant performance improvements.

### âœ… Key Benefits

- **3-5x faster processing** for multiple audio samples
- **GPU optimization** through vectorized operations
- **Automatic padding** for variable-length audio samples
- **Memory efficient** batch operations
- **Backward compatible** - existing code continues to work

### âœ… Supported Operations

- `batch_extract_unit()`: Extract units from multiple audio samples at once
- `batch_decode_unit()`: Decode multiple units back to audio at once  
- `batch_synth()`: Complete synthesis pipeline for multiple samples

### âœ… All Codecs Supported

Every codec in Codec-SUPERB includes optimized batch processing:

- **EnCodec** (all variants): True tensor batching with automatic padding
- **SpeechTokenizer**: RVQ-aware batch processing  
- **AudioDec**: Quantizer-optimized batch operations
- **HuggingFace EnCodec**: Native transformer batch processing
- **Descript Audio Codec**: Batch compression/decompression

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voidful/Codec-SUPERB.git
cd Codec-SUPERB
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Single Audio Processing

Traditional single audio processing (still fully supported):

```python
from SoundCodec import codec
import torchaudio

# get all available codec
print(codec.list_codec())
# load codec by name, use encodec as example
encodec_24k_6bps = codec.load_codec('encodec_24k_6bps')

# load audio
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load('sample_audio.wav')
resampled_waveform = waveform.numpy()[-1]
data_item = {'audio': {'array': resampled_waveform,
                       'sampling_rate': sample_rate}}

# extract unit
sound_unit = encodec_24k_6bps.extract_unit(data_item).unit

# sound synthesis
decoded_waveform = encodec_24k_6bps.synth(data_item, local_save=False)['audio']['array']
```

### Batch Audio Processing

**ðŸš€ NEW: Process multiple audio samples efficiently:**

```python
from SoundCodec import codec
import torchaudio

# load codec
encodec_24k_6bps = codec.load_codec('encodec_24k_6bps')

# prepare multiple audio samples
audio_files = ['audio1.wav', 'audio2.wav', 'audio3.wav']
data_list = []

for audio_file in audio_files:
    waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load(audio_file)
    data_item = {
        'id': audio_file,
        'audio': {
            'array': waveform.numpy()[0],  # take first channel
            'sampling_rate': sample_rate
        }
    }
    data_list.append(data_item)

# OPTION 1: Batch extraction and decoding (recommended)
batch_extracted = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_extract_unit(data_list)
print(f"Extracted {batch_extracted.batch_size} samples")
print(f"Unit shapes: {[unit.shape for unit in batch_extracted.units]}")

batch_decoded = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_decode_unit(batch_extracted)
print(f"Decoded audio shapes: {[audio.shape for audio in batch_decoded]}")

# OPTION 2: Complete batch synthesis pipeline
results = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_synth(data_list, local_save=False)
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Sample {i}: unit shape {result['unit'].shape}, "
          f"audio shape {result['audio']['array'].shape}")
```

### Performance Comparison

Compare single vs batch processing performance:

```python
import time

# Single processing (old approach)
start_time = time.time()
single_results = []
for data in data_list:
    extracted = encodec_24k_6bps.extract_unit(data)
    decoded = encodec_24k_6bps.decode_unit(extracted.stuff_for_synth)
    single_results.append(decoded)
single_time = time.time() - start_time

# Batch processing (new approach)  
start_time = time.time()
batch_extracted = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_extract_unit(data_list)
batch_results = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_decode_unit(batch_extracted)
batch_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Single processing: {single_time:.3f}s")
print(f"Batch processing: {batch_time:.3f}s") 
print(f"Speedup: {single_time/batch_time:.2f}x")
```

### Advanced Batch Processing Tips

**Group samples by length for optimal performance:**

```python
# Group samples by similar lengths
short_samples = [data for data in data_list if len(data['audio']['array']) < 48000]
long_samples = [data for data in data_list if len(data['audio']['array']) >= 48000]

# Process each group separately for better efficiency
if short_samples:
    short_results = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_extract_unit(short_samples)
if long_samples:
    long_results = encodec_24k_6bps.batch_extract_unit(long_samples)
```

**Process large datasets in chunks:**

```python
def process_large_dataset(codec, data_list, batch_size=8):
    all_results = []
    for i in range(0, len(data_list), batch_size):
        batch = data_list[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_results = codec.batch_synth(batch, local_save=False)
        all_results.extend(batch_results)
    return all_results

# Process large dataset efficiently
large_results = process_large_dataset(encodec_24k_6bps, large_data_list)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify codec functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest SoundCodec/test/

# Run batch processing tests specifically
python -m pytest SoundCodec/test/test_batch_processing.py -v

# Run performance benchmarks
python SoundCodec/test/benchmark_batch_performance.py
```
